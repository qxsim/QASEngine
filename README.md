# QASEngine

This is a fully-featured Game Rendering Engine built from scratch using Java (JavaFX). I designed and built this to learn more about how games work and I wanted to get as deep as I could into the details, so decided to build my own renderer from scratch using a powerful language I was comfortable with. 

I made a simple test level called 'FightNight!' which is a simple multiplayer 2D side-scrolling fighting level which showcases all of the features of my engine.
